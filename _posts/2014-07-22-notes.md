##Morning

* Spent some time this morning reading on machine learning. Discovered [Metacademy](http://metacademy.org) as a potentially useful resource. Also found this old Coursera course run by Geoff Hinton from University of Toronto: [Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001). I am still kicking myself for not realizing that Univerisity of Toronto has a world-class machine learning department, while I was there, so I could have taken advantage of it. How did I not know that? To be fair, though, I had not really gotten into machine learning yet when I finished there.

* Worked on a script to run Artificial Life Network ([ALF](http://alfsim.org)) from R. Script uses `whisker` to plug R values into a mustache template of a basic ALF configuration file, then runs ALF on it. This just does what I need it to for my Alignment-free Diversity (#AFD) project for now. But I hope I can expand this into a full framework for running all of ALF functionality.
