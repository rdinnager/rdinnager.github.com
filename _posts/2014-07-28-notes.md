##Morning

* Worked on #LDA-metagenomics project. Did a bit more on testing assumption of the project [here](http://rdinnager.github.io/LDA-metagenomics/assumption_test).

##Todo

* Need to make a "Current Projects" index page with links to each of my github repos. I am starting to forget what some of them are called.
