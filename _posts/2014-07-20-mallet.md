I just came across a potentially useful R package called [mallet](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mallet/index.html), which interfaces with [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/): a Java based software package for machine learning text analysis. It can fit a lot of topic models such as LDA and Heirarchical Dirichlet Processes (I think). Importantly, it can fit Pachinko Allocation topic models, which I have been meaning to look into as a potential model to look for structure in metagenomics datasets. Might be the next step after I give Latent Dirichlet Allocation models a try.
