I can't believe it has been a year since I posted in my open science notebook. It has mainly been because I have not done that much science really. Oh I have still been working on things here and there, but not being paid reduced my motivation to be productive. Plus I did want to actually enjoy a rare break from work. Well, that is over now! I got a new postdoc job at the Australian National University in Canberra. I will be working with Marcel Cardillo and Lindell Bromham in their Macroevolution and Macroecology group.
