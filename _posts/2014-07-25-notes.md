##Morning

* Worked on "modelling ecological processes using multiple biodiversity metrics" proposal.

##Afternoon

* Thought a little about whether it might be possible to write a static page generator for blogging entirely in R. The work-horse would be the `knitr` package. I can imagine initially an R script which takes a directory of `.Rmd` files, and knits any unknit ones into `.md` files, as well as constructing a basic index page using a template. Then one could just push this to a github page to be rendered. Or `knitr` could directly knit to `.html`, and R could be hosted on the server using `RServe` or something like that. The index page could be created as another `index.Rmd` document that uses R code chunks to grab the list of `.Rmd` posts and their info, and uses custom hooks in `knitr` to format the output. I know Ruby and Jekyll already have great functionality for this, but sometimes its nice to stay in R (I barely know any Ruby). Just a thought. I might try something like this for this page eventually.

* Worked on #LDA-metagenomics project a bit. Worked on getting data simulated to test some assumptions of the analysis. See [here](http://rdinnager.github.io/LDA-metagenomics/assumption_test) for this initial work.
